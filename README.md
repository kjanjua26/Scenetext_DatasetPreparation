# Scenetext_DatasetPreparation
Contains the datasets used for scenetext recognititon and detection along with the scripts used to convert those datasets into desireable formats. 
The images are .png and the groundtruth is .gt.txt format. LSTM along with CTC stacked on top is used. The current accuracy on mix dataset such as this is about 75%.
Improvements are under progress.
The datasets used are by: 

1. ICDAR Challenge 1
2. ICDAR 2013
3. IIIT Scene text 5000 images
4. KAIST Dataset
5. VGG Dataset
